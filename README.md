# Senior Blockchain Engineer, Full-stack Web2 & Web3 Engineer

*** Tip:
_If you're looking for an engineer who is simply affordable and minimally qualified, merely working for a salary, then I'm sorry I may not be the right fit...

However, IF you're seeking a senior-level expert with deep technical mastery, proven real-world experience, and a passion for driving team success—then let’s talk. I’m available anytime and eager to collaborate!_
